               <p>Main article:<a href="">pre historic ethiopia</a></p>
               <p>Several important finds have propelled Ethiopia and the surrounding region to the forefront of palaeontology.
                 The oldest hominid discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2 million-year-old Ardipithecus ramidus (Ardi) found by Tim D. 
                 White in 1994.[45] The most well-known hominid discovery is Australopithecus afarensis (Lucy).
                  Known locally as Dinkinesh, the specimen was found in the Awash Valley of Afar Region in 1974 by Donald Johanson, 
                  and is one of the most complete and best preserved adult Australopithecine fossils ever uncovered. 
                  Lucy's taxonomic name refers to the region where the discovery was made.
                 This hominid is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago.[46][47][48]</p>
